        "\n",
        "1. **SQLAlchemy Setup**: Always import necessary components and create engine, base, and session factory\n",
        "2. **Model Definition**: Use declarative base and define table name, columns, and relationships\n",
        "3. **CRUD Operations**: Master Create, Read, Update, Delete operations with proper session management\n",
        "4. **Session Management**: Always close sessions and use context managers when possible\n",
        "5. **Column Types**: Choose appropriate column types for your data (String, Integer, DateTime, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "## üí° Alternative Solutions\n",
        "\n",
        "There are often multiple ways to solve the same problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Model Names**: Student, Book, Car, Product - choose what fits your scenario\n",
        "- **Column Types**: String vs Text, Integer vs Float - choose based on data requirements\n",
        "- **Session Management**: Manual vs context manager - context manager is preferred\n",
        "- **Query Methods**: filter() vs filter_by() - both work, choose based on preference\n",
        "\n",
        "## üöÄ Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "You've mastered the fundamentals of SQLAlchemy ORM! You're ready to move on to:\n",
        "- Advanced model relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)\n",
        "- Complex queries and joins\n",
        "- Database migrations\n",
        "- Performance optimization\n",
        "- Integration with web frameworks\n",
        "\n",
