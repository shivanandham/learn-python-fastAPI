        "- **CREATE**: Use `session.add()`, `session.add_all()`, and `bulk_save_objects()` appropriately\n",
        "- **READ**: Master filtering, sorting, pagination, and relationship queries\n",
        "- **UPDATE**: Use direct updates, bulk updates, and conditional updates\n",
        "- **DELETE**: Handle single deletes, bulk deletes, and cascade deletes\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advanced Query Techniques\n",
        "- **Aggregations**: Use `func.count()`, `func.avg()`, `func.min()`, `func.max()`\n",
        "- **Grouping**: Use `group_by()` for summary statistics\n",
        "- **Subqueries**: Use scalar subqueries and `exists()` for complex filtering\n",
        "- **Joins**: Leverage relationships and explicit joins for related data\n",
        "\n",
        "### Transaction Management\n",
        "- **Error Handling**: Always use try/except blocks for database operations\n",
        "- **Rollbacks**: Use `session.rollback()` to undo failed transactions\n",
        "- **Context Managers**: Use `session.begin()` for automatic transaction management\n",
        "- **Session Management**: Always close sessions to free resources\n",
        "\n",
        "### Performance Considerations\n",
        "- **Bulk Operations**: Use `bulk_save_objects()` and `update()` for large datasets\n",
        "- **Query Optimization**: Use appropriate loading strategies and joins\n",
        "- **Indexing**: Consider database indexes for frequently queried columns\n",
