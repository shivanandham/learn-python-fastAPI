        "\n",
        "1. **File Modes**: Choose the right mode for your needs\n",
        "   - `'r'` for reading existing files\n",
        "   - `'w'` for creating new files or overwriting existing ones\n",
        "   - `'a'` for appending to existing files\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Context Managers**: Always use `with` statements for file operations\n",
        "   - Automatically closes files even if errors occur\n",
        "   - More readable and safer than manual file handling\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Error Handling**: Always handle potential file errors\n",
        "   - `FileNotFoundError` for missing files\n",
        "   - `PermissionError` for access issues\n",
        "   - Use try/except blocks for robust code\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Formats**: Choose appropriate formats for your data\n",
        "   - Text files for simple content\n",
        "   - CSV for tabular data\n",
        "   - JSON for structured data with nested objects\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **File Reading Methods**: Different methods for different needs\n",
        "   - `read()` for entire file content\n",
        "   - `readlines()` for list of lines\n",
        "   - Iteration for memory-efficient line-by-line reading\n",
        "\n",
        "## üí° Alternative Solutions\n",
        "\n",
        "There are often multiple ways to solve the same problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **File Reading**: `read()` vs `readlines()` vs iteration - choose based on memory needs\n",
        "- **Error Handling**: Specific exceptions vs general `Exception` - be as specific as possible\n",
        "- **Data Storage**: CSV vs JSON vs plain text - choose based on data complexity\n",
        "- **File Paths**: Relative vs absolute paths - use what's appropriate for your project\n",
        "\n",
        "## üöÄ Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "You've mastered the fundamentals of file I/O! You're ready to move on to:\n",
